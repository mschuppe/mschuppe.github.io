My interest in voice draws me into the area between music and language. 
An area where the grain of words merges with the fluidity of sound. +
This suspense is guiding my commitment since the eightees, when I began to delve
into the music of link:/recording/index.html#scelsi[Giacinto Scelsi] and link:/recording/index.html#feldman[Morton Feldman]
and I have pursued it in different ways and collaborations: link:/recording/index.html#selbdritt[improvisation], interpretation, 
reweighing the traditional ingredients of link:/recording/index.html#nosongs[song], developing
projects with and link:/works/index.html#summe[for voices], link:/mentor/index.html#summe[teaching], writing. +
In recent years, I have turned more deliberately to the borderlands where music passes into link:/now/index.html#buch[poetry].
In this vein link:/csl/index.html[colline sur livre] is since 2022 an ongoing work.
