[.big]#My interest in voice draws me into the area between music and language. 
An area which I see as the coast between words and music, where the grain of language and the fluidity of sound converge. +
This suspense is guiding my commitment since the eightees, when I began to delve
into the music link:/recording/index.html#scelsi[Giacinto Scelsi] and link:/recording/index.html#feldman[Morton Feldman], in various ways and collaborations: link:/recording/index.html#selbdritt[improvisation], interpretation, reweighing the traditional ingredients of link:/recording/index.html#nosongs[song], developing
projects with and link:/works/index.html#summe[for voices], link:/mentor/index.html#summe[teaching, mentoring], writing. +
In recent years I have more specifically explored the borderlands where music extends into link:/now/index.html#buch[poetry].
In this vein link:/csl/index.html[colline sur livre] is my most recent and ongoing work.#
