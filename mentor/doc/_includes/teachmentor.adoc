== Voice & Words - mentoring for composer-performers

Since the mid-eightees I have enjoyed passing on my experiences as a singer, performer and
teacher to others.

.My background in teaching
I have trained singers, dancers, teachers and other enthusiasts in developing their voices in
groups and individual lessons. I have worked in theatre-and dance-productions as a voice
teacher and musical advisor and have given masterclasses and lectures on my work in Europe and Asia. 
From 1995-2010 I have educated singers and speakers in the Atem-Tonus-Ton-
method in Switzerland, Germany and Japan. Between 2012 and 2022 I have been working as a
guest-lecturer for voice and improvisation at the FHNW University of Music in Basel and other
swiss university-music departments. I also have been the director of a voice
ensemble, focused on improvisation and staged several performance-projects.


.My approach to words in music and to the music of words 
_began years after I had experimented with
the instrumental sounds and qualities of voice. I had been reluctant to accept the weight of meaning and
its tradition. Only when I realized how endless sound and meaning are intertwined my curiosity
awoke and my attitude changed._

_It is this experience that I propose to share in one-to-one sessions with individuals or small
groups of composer-performers._


With the term of composer-performers I refer to musicians and performers that want to
develop their own music or built something new with existing elements.
In these mentoring sessions we agree on a set of goals - based on a short description of
your project (voice or voice and instrument) - including but not limited to:

* develop a new perspective on words in music
* widen your understanding of the connection of sound and meaning
* challenge your attitude towards the perfection of voice
* deepen your experience of voice and body resonance


.Conditions
Sessions take place in a series of 3 or 5 meetings in Basel, one to one
and are based on your personal needs and questions.
We meet in person in my atelier in Basel. 

If you wish to come in an ensemble working on a piece, we will work out an arrangement.

Financial terms to be discussed on a case by case basis.

If you are interested please <<contact, contact>> me.
If you need a place to stay in Basel I can help finding accomodation.
