My interest in voice draws me into the area between music and language. 
An area which I see as the coast between words and music, where the grain of language and the fluidity of sound converge.
This suspense is guiding my commitment since the eightees, when I began to delve
into the music of xref:index.adoc#scelsi[Giacinto Scelsi] and xref:index.adoc#feldman[Morton Feldman], in various ways and collaborations: xref:index.adoc#selbdritt[improvisation], interpretation, reweighing the traditional ingredients of xref:index.adoc#nosongs[song], developing
projects with and xref:index.adoc#summe[for voices], xref:index.adoc#teaching[teaching, mentoring], writing.
In recent years I have more specifically moved in the borderlands where music extends into xref:index.adoc#buch[poetry] and speaking voice, multilingual.
In this vein xref:index.adoc#colline[colline sur livre] is my most recent and ongoing work.
