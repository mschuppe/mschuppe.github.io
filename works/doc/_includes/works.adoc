Listening to a voice, one may hear sounds or words. Words are linked to a specific language and understanding. Sounds may hide the voice as a human source. Though sounds are not bound to a specific vocabulary, they are as well carrying meaning, intended or not.
Words and sounds constitute the presence of voice and do not exist independently. Both have a specific physicality. They interact, within or outside language. Together they unfold the complexity of singing.

My compositions are rooted in my practise as a singer, vocalist, writer and teacher.
Steps throughout these interweaving acitivities were :
song - movement - improvisation - sound - breath - word - song - extended. Find a selection of my pieces here:
